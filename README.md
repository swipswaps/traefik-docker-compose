# Traefik

![deploy](https://github.com/warnyul/traefik-docker-compose/workflows/deploy/badge.svg)

I created this repo for personal use. My goal was to easily publish web applications under my domain name.
Traefik helped me a lot. My applications no matter how and where I want to access them. It works with Swarm for now, but I plan to build my infrastructure with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) later.

So, this configuration runs a Traefik service in Swarm Mode with following configurations:
* automatic cert resolving with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org),
* global HTTP to HTTPS redirection with STS header,
* global www to non-www redirection,
* and a dashboard, which has been restricted by [Digest Authentication](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/digestauth/).

## Requirements

This compose file has been created for my Droplet on Digital Ocean, so you need one, or you just modify the `certresolver` configuration in [docker-compose.acme.yml](docker-compose.acme.yml) file.

## Environment settings

Environment variables are stored in .env files. I know to manage `.env` files are not supported by `docker stack deploy` command. However, I like this idea to manage environment variables with `.env` files. So, I have created two files (`.env`, `.env.dev`). So, I use `source` command to load variables from `.env` files. I have two shell scripts. One for start the application on local machine ([start.sh](./scripts/start.sh)), and another to deploy the application to remote.

I recommend to do not store `.env` file in git. Better, if this is safely stored in CI/CD, Vault or other secret management software.

### For deployment

To deploy this Traefik service, you need to set the following two environment variables before run [deploy.sh](./scripts/deploy.sh). I use Daemon sockets to publish my services to Digital Ocean. If you are not comfortable with this just jump to the [How to use on my server?](./README.md#How-to-use-on-my-server?) to use on my server?) section to read alternative solutions.

* `HOST`: Host without port number for Daemon socket(s) to connect to. The deploy script default connects to the 2376 port.
* `DOCKER_STACK`: A stack name to deploy service with `docker stack deploy` command. It also used for external network definitions.

### Traefik service
* `DOMAIN`: The domain name where Traefik will listen, and it is already used for certificate resolving too.
* `LOG_LEVEL`: Log level of Traefik. Logging levels are `DEBUG`, `PANIC`, `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, and `INFO`.
* `DOCKER_STACK`: Used for set `traefik.provider.docker.network` variable.

### Tls (only used in production)
* `ACME_EMAIL`: An email address, which has been used by [ACME](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) to create and renew certificates.
* `DO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Digital Ocean authentication token, which has been used by ACME to resolve `CNAME` when creating `dns-01` challenge.

### Traefik Dashboard
* `DASHBOARD_CREDENTIALS`: Credentials to access Traefik's dashboard. Use `htdigest` to generate credentials. For example: `htdigest -c pwd.txt admin traefik`.
* `DASHBOARD_SUBDOMAIN`: Subdomain where you want to access Traefik's dashboard.

## How to run on a local machine?

Before you start the service, you should run `./scripts/setup.sh` to prepare the development environment on your machine.
This will create a DNS server, which makes easy the subdomain management.

After that, run `./scripts/start.sh`.

By default, Traefik's dashboard will be accessible with _admin:admin_ credentials on https://traefik.bvarga.localhost.

## How to use on my server?

First, you should protect Docker daemon sockets on your server. You can use my setup script [here](https://github.com/warnyul/digital-ocean-setup#protect_dockersh), but this just generates some config file without certificates. So, I recommend you to follow the official documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/). Do not forget to set up your client certificates as well.

After that, set up environment variables too, based on what you read earlier.

Finally, run `./scripts/deploy.sh`

If you are not comfortable with this, just check out this repo on your server, then set up environment variables and run `./scripts/start.sh`. Just remember this script using `.env.dev` file, so you should set up variables in this file.
